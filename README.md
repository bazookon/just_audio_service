# just_audio_service

In early stages of development.
Intended to be a robust, well written, easy to use implementation of audio_service using just_audio.
Note that initial goal is only to support a limited set of requirements, not to be properly configurable.
That being said, I hope that it is a good starting point for others to base their implementations off.
